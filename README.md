# Horror Game

Welcome to my horror game project! This is one of my first attempts at game development.

## Game Description

- **Genre:** Horror
- **Type:** 3D
- **Development Stage:** Early

## About the Code

This project is written in C# using the Unity game development engine.

Important Scripts:
- **PlayerMovement:** Allows the player to move

- **PlayerController:** Pending

- **MoveCamera:** Pending

- **PlayerCamMov:** Pending

- **Tree Placement / PlaceObjects:** The script (`PlaceObjects.cs`) is responsible for dynamically placing trees in a specified area. It uses a custom prefab with improved collision and applies a kinematic Rigidbody to prevent trees from falling.

- **Prefabs:** The project utilizes some custom prefabs specific for some of the scripts above.

## Note

As this is one of my initial game development projects, feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated.
